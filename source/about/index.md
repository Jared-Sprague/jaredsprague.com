Hello! I'm Jared Sprague.  I am a software engineer, but I also create Indy Games for <a href="http://scripta.co">scripta.co</a>.  I also like to <a href="http://soulfiregems.com">cut gems</a> and train Capoeira as a hobby.  I have two cool kids that make me laugh all the time, and and married to my soul mate Jessica Sprague.
